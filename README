 ***read me		*************************************************
 *	  
 *	VoluniApp is a Chrome application (plugin), its aim is to improove
 *	the experience of Volunia Users giving a way to bring Volunia outside
 *	of its own domain (www.volunia.com)!
 *
 *		O.o What can I do with VoluniApp ?
 *
 *	*You can surf on every website (also the ones that are blocked inside 
 *	 Volunia) having full access to the chat!
 *
 *	*You have full access to the private chat!
 *
 *	*You can use the "reach me" function to reach other Users around the web
 *
 *	*You can see other Users online in the webpage that you are watching
 *
 *	*VoluniApp is a way to overcome the iframe problem and to bring Volunia
 *	 with you around the web!
 *	
 *		O.o Settings:
 *
 *	Onece you have installed VoluniApp a small button near the address bar 
 *	will appear, with that you can change the behaviour of VoluniApp:
 *
 *	*On/Off: if you want to disable for some time VoluniApp just turn it off!
 *
 *	*Show/Hide: you can choose to use a shortcut to show and hide VoluniApp or
 *	 you can choose the autohide setting (VoluniApp will disappear when you click away)
 *
 *	*Volunia Button: if you enable this option a small button will be injected when 
 *	 you are visiting www.volunia.com, this button will bring you outside Volunia 
 *	(useful when you want to visit a website that does not support iframes)
 *
 *	*Adapt Content: an experimental feature to avoid overlapping between VoluniApp 
 *	 and the webpage that you are visiting.
 *
 *		O.o Beta:
 *
 *	VoluniApp is still under testing, you can contact me whenever you want by 
 *	mail (marco.ferrarotti@gmail.com) to submit bugs report, suggestions, collaboration 
 *	proposal or whatever :)
 *
 *		O.o Thank You!
 *
 *	Thank you to have installed VoluniApp, I hope you will enjoy it !
